Version control systems (VCSs) are tools used to track changes to source code
(or other collections of files and folders). As the name implies, these tools
help maintain a history of changes; furthermore, they facilitate collaboration.
VCSs track changes to a folder and its contents in a series of snapshots, where
each snapshot encapsulates the entire state of files/folders within a top-level
directory. VCSs also maintain metadata like who created each snapshot, messages
associated with each snapshot, and so on.

Why is version control useful? Even when you're working by yourself, it can let
you look at old snapshots of a project, keep a log of why certain changes were
made, work on parallel branches of development, and much more. When working
with others, it's an invaluable tool for seeing what other people have changed,
as well as resolving conflicts in concurrent development.

Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions
like:

- Who wrote this module?
- When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why
  was it edited?
- Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did a particular unit test stop
working?

While other VCSs exist, **Git** is the de facto standard for version control.
This [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1597/) captures Git's reputation:

![xkcd 1597](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

Because Git's interface is a leaky abstraction, learning Git top-down (starting
with its interface / command-line interface) can lead to a lot of confusion.
It's possible to memorize a handful of commands and think of them as magic
incantations, and follow the approach in the comic above whenever anything goes
wrong.

While Git admittedly has an ugly interface, its underlying design and ideas are
beautiful. While an ugly interface has to be _memorized_, a beautiful design
can be _understood_. For this reason, we give a bottom-up explanation of Git,
starting with its data model and later covering the command-line interface.
Once the data model is understood, the commands can be better understood, in
terms of how they manipulate the underlying data model.

# Git's data model

There are many ad-hoc approaches you could take to version control. Git has a
well thought-out model that enables all the nice features of version control,
like maintaining history, supporting branches, and enabling collaboration.

## Snapshots

Git models the history of a collection of files and folders within some
top-level directory as a series of snapshots. In Git terminology, a file is
called a "blob", and it's just a bunch of bytes. A directory is called a
"tree", and it maps names to blobs or trees (so directories can contain other
directories). A snapshot is the top-level tree that is being tracked. For
example, we might have a tree as follows:

```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

The top-level tree contains two elements, a tree "foo" (that itself contains
one element, a blob "bar.txt"), and a blob "baz.txt".

## Modeling history: relating snapshots

How should a version control system relate snapshots? One simple model would be
to have a linear history. A history would be a list of snapshots in time-order.
For many reasons, Git doesn't use a simple model like this.

In Git, a history is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of snapshots. That may
sound like a fancy math word, but don't be intimidated. All this means is that
each snapshot in Git refers to a set of "parents", the snapshots that preceded
it. It's a set of parents rather than a single parent (as would be the case in
a linear history) because a snapshot might descend from multiple parents, for
example due to combining (merging) two parallel branches of development.

Git calls these snapshots "commit"s. Visualizing a commit history might look
something like this:

```
o <-- o <-- o <-- o
            ^
             \
              --- o <-- o
```

In the ASCII art above, the `o`s correspond to individual commits (snapshots).
The arrows point to the parent of each commit (it's a "comes before" relation,
not "comes after"). After the third commit, the history branches into two
separate branches. This might correspond to, for example, two separate features
being developed in parallel, independently from each other. In the future,
these branches may be merged to create a new snapshot that incorporates both of
the features, producing a new history that looks like this, with the newly
created merge commit shown in bold:

<pre>
o <-- o <-- o <-- o <---- <strong>o</strong>
            ^            /
             \          v
              --- o <-- o
</pre>

Commits in Git are immutable. This doesn't mean that mistakes can't be
corrected, however; it's just that "edits" to the commit history are actually
creating entirely new commits, and references (see below) are updated to point
to the new ones.

## Data model, as pseudocode

It may be instructive to see Git's data model written down in pseudocode:

```
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parent: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

It's a clean, simple model of history.

## Objects and content-addressing

An "object" is a blob, tree, or commit:

```
type object = blob | tree | commit
```

In Git data store, all objects are content-addressed by their [SHA-1
hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1).

```
objects = map<string, object>

def store(object):
    id = sha1(object)
    objects[id] = object

def load(id):
    return objects[id]
```

Blobs, trees, and commits are unified in this way: they are all objects. When
they reference other objects, they don't actually _contain_ them in their
on-disk representation, but have a reference to them by their hash.

For example, the tree for the example directory structure [above](#snapshots)
(visualized using `git cat-file -p 698281bc680d1995c5f4caaf3359721a5a58d48d`),
looks like this:

```
100644 blob 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85    baz.txt
040000 tree c68d233a33c5c06e0340e4c224f0afca87c8ce87    foo
```

The tree itself contains pointers to its contents, `baz.txt` (a blob) and `foo`
(a tree). If we look at the contents addressed by the hash corresponding to
baz.txt with `git cat-file -p 4448adbf7ecd394f42ae135bbeed9676e894af85`, we get
the following:

```
git is wonderful
```

## References

Now, all snapshots can be identified by their SHA-1 hash. That's inconvenient,
because humans aren't good at remembering strings of 40 hexadecimal characters.

Git's solution to this problem is human-readable names for SHA-1 hashes, called
"references". References are pointers to commits. Unlike objects, which are
immutable, references are mutable (can be updated to point to a new commit).
For example, the `master` reference usually points to the latest commit in the
main branch of development.

```
references = map<string, string>

def update_reference(name, id):
    references[name] = id

def read_reference(name):
    return references[name]

def load_reference(name_or_id):
    if name_or_id in references:
        return load(references[name_or_id])
    else:
        return load(name_or_id)
```

With this, Git can use human-readable names like "master" to refer to a
particular snapshot in the history, instead of a long hexadecimal string.

One detail is that we often want a notion of "where we currently are" in the
history, so that when we take a new snapshot, we know what it is relative to
(how we set the `parents` field of the commit). In Git, that "where we
currently are" is a special reference called "HEAD".

## Repositories

Finally, we can define what (roughly) is a Git _repository_: it is the data
`objects` and `references`.

On disk, all Git stores are objects and references: that's all there is to Git's
data model. All `git` commands map to some manipulation of the commit DAG by
adding objects and adding/updating references.

Whenever you're typing in any command, think about what manipulation the
command is making to the underlying graph data structure. Conversely, if you're
trying to make a particular kind of change to the commit DAG, e.g. "discard
uncommitted changes and make the 'master' ref point to commit `5d83f9e`", there's
probably a command to do it (e.g. in this case, `git checkout master; git reset
--hard 5d83f9e`).

# Staging area

This is another concept that's orthogonal to the data model, but it's a part of
the interface to create commits.

One way you might imagine implementing snapshotting as described above is to have
a "create snapshot" command that creates a new snapshot based on the _current
state_ of the working directory. Some version control tools work like this, but
not Git. We want clean snapshots, and it might not always be ideal to make a
snapshot from the current state. For example, imagine a scenario where you've
implemented two separate features, and you want to create two separate commits,
where the first introduces the first feature, and the next introduces the
second feature. Or imagine a scenario where you have debugging print statements
added all over your code, along with a bugfix; you want to commit the bugfix
while discarding all the print statements.

Git accommodates such scenarios by allowing you to specify which modifications
should be included in the next snapshot through a mechanism called the "staging
area".

# Git command-line interface

To avoid duplicating information, we're not going to explain the commands below
in detail. See the highly recommended [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
for more information, or watch the lecture video.

## Basics

{% comment %}

The `git init` command initializes a new Git repository, with repository
metadata being stored in the `.git` directory:

```console
$ mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/missing-semester/myproject/.git/
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

How do we interpret this output? "No commits yet" basically means our version
history is empty. Let's fix that.

```console
$ echo "hello, git" > hello.txt
$ git add hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   hello.txt

$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
[master (root-commit) 4515d17] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

With this, we've `git add`ed a file to the staging area, and then `git
commit`ed that change, adding a simple commit message "Initial commit". If we
didn't specify a `-m` option, Git would open our text editor to allow us type a
commit message.

Now that we have a non-empty version history, we can visualize the history.
Visualizing the history as a DAG can be especially helpful in understanding the
current status of the repo and connecting it with your understanding of the Git
data model.

The `git log` command visualizes history. By default, it shows a flattened
version, which hides the graph structure. If you use a command like `git log
--all --graph --decorate`, it will show you the full version history of the
repository, visualized in graph form.

```console
$ git log --all --graph --decorate
* commit 4515d17a167bdef0a91ee7d50d75b12c9c2652aa (HEAD -> master)
  Author: Missing Semester <missing-semester@mit.edu>
  Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:18:36 2020 -0500

      Initial commit
```

This doesn't look all that graph-like, because it only contains a single node.
Let's make some more changes, author a new commit, and visualize the history
once more.

```console
$ echo "another line" >> hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   hello.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add hello.txt
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

        modified:   hello.txt

$ git commit -m 'Add a line'
[master 35f60a8] Add a line
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Now, if we visualize the history again, we'll see some of the graph structure:

```
* commit 35f60a825be0106036dd2fbc7657598eb7b04c67 (HEAD -> master)
| Author: Missing Semester <missing-semester@mit.edu>
| Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:26:20 2020 -0500
|
|     Add a line
|
* commit 4515d17a167bdef0a91ee7d50d75b12c9c2652aa
  Author: Anish Athalye <me@anishathalye.com>
  Date:   Tue Jan 21 22:18:36 2020 -0500

      Initial commit
```

Also, note that it shows the current HEAD, along with the current branch
(master).

We can look at old versions using the `git checkout` command.

```console
$ git checkout 4515d17  # previous commit hash; yours will be different
Note: checking out '4515d17'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 4515d17 Initial commit
$ cat hello.txt
hello, git
$ git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was 4515d17 Initial commit
Switched to branch 'master'
$ cat hello.txt
hello, git
another line
```

Git can show you how files have evolved (differences, or diffs) using the `git
diff` command:

```console
$ git diff 4515d17 hello.txt
diff --git c/hello.txt w/hello.txt
index 94bab17..f0013b2 100644
--- c/hello.txt
+++ w/hello.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello, git
 +another line
```

## Branching and merging

{% comment %}

Branching allows you to "fork" version history. It can be helpful for working
on independent features or bug fixes in parallel. The `git branch` command can
be used to create new branches; `git checkout -b <branch name>` creates and
branch and checks it out.

Merging is the opposite of branching: it allows you to combine forked version
histories, e.g. merging a feature branch back into master. The `git merge`
command is used for merging.

# Miscellaneous

- **GUIs**: there are many [GUI clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)
out there for Git. We personally don't use them and use the command-line
interface instead.
- **Shell integration**: it's super handy to have a Git status as part of your
shell prompt ([zsh](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt),
[bash](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt)). Often included in
frameworks like [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
- **Editor integration**: similarly to the above, handy integrations with many
features. [fugitive.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is the standard
one for Vim.
- **Workflows**: we taught you the data model, plus some basic commands; we
didn't tell you what practices to follow when working on big projects (and
there are [many](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
[different](https://www.endoflineblog.com/gitflow-considered-harmful)
[approaches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)).
- **GitHub**: Git is not GitHub. GitHub has a specific way of contributing code
to other projects, called [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
- **Other Git providers**: GitHub is not special: there are many Git repository
hosts, like [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and
[BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

# Exercises

1. If you don't have any past experience with Git, either try reading the first
   couple chapters of [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or go through a
   tutorial like [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/). As
   you're working through it, relate Git commands to the data model.
1. Clone the [repository for the
class website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester).
    1. Explore the version history by visualizing it as a graph.
    1. Who was the last person to modify `README.md`? (Hint: use `git log` with
       an argument)
    1. What was the commit message associated with the last modification to the
       `collections:` line of `_config.yml`? (Hint: use `git blame` and `git
       show`)
1. One common mistake when learning Git is to commit large files that should
   not be managed by Git or adding sensitive information. Try adding a file to
   a repository, making some commits and then deleting that file from history
   (you may want to look at
   [this](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/)).
1. Clone some repository from GitHub, and modify one of its existing files.
   What happens when you do `git stash`? What do you see when running `git log
   --all --oneline`? Run `git stash pop` to undo what you did with `git stash`.
   In what scenario might this be useful?
1. Like many command line tools, Git provides a configuration file (or dotfile)
   called `~/.gitconfig`. Create an alias in `~/.gitconfig` so that when you
   run `git graph`, you get the output of `git log --all --graph --decorate
   --oneline`.
1. You can define global ignore patterns in `~/.gitignore_global` after running
   `git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global`. Do this, and
   set up your global gitignore file to ignore OS-specific or editor-specific
   temporary files, like `.DS_Store`.
1. Clone the [repository for the class
   website](https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester), find a typo
   or some other improvement you can make, and submit a pull request on GitHub.
