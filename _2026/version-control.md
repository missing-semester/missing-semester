This page is under construction for the IAP 2026 offering of Missing Semester. This lecture will cover topics similar to the [Version Control (Git)](/2020/version-control/) lecture from the 2020 offering.
</span>

In this lecture, we'll cover:

- Git, bottom-up, starting with the data model, like we did in the 2020 lecture
- Modern Git [porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) (e.g., `git restore` over `git checkout` when appropriate)
- Advanced topics such as git worktrees
