<h1 class="title">404</h1>
    <p>The most common reason for a 404 error is that the requested resource or page cannot be found on the server. This can be due to various reasons such as:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The URL is incorrect or has a typo.</li>
      <li>The requested resource or page has been deleted or moved to a different location.</li>
      <li>The server is down or experiencing technical difficulties.</li>
      <li>The user does not have the necessary permissions to access the resource or page.</li>
      <li>The user's internet connection is not stable, causing the request to fail.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the context of web development, it's important to handle 404 errors gracefully by providing a custom error page or message to the user, which can help improve the user experience and provide helpful information about the error.</p>
