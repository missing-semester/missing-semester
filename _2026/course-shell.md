# Who are we?

This class is co-taught by [Anish](https://anish.io/),
[Jon](https://thesquareplanet.com/), and [Jose](http://josejg.com/). We
are all ex-MIT students who started this MIT IAP class back when we were
students. You can reach us collectively at
[missing-semester@mit.edu](mailto:missing-semester@mit.edu).

We are not paid to teach this class, and do not monetize the class in
any way. We make all the [course
materials](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) and [recordings of the
lectures](https://www.youtube.com/@MissingSemester) freely available
online. If you want to support our work, the best way to do so is to
simply spread the word about the class. If you're a company, university,
or other organization that runs this content past larger cohorts, please
send us experience reports/testimonials by email so we get to hear about
it :)

# Motivation

As computer scientists, we know that computers are great at aiding in
repetitive tasks. However, far too often, we forget that this applies
just as much to our _use_ of the computer as it does to the computations
we want our programs to perform. We have a vast range of tools available
at our fingertips that enable us to be more productive and solve more
complex problems when working on any computer-related problem. Yet many
of us utilize only a small fraction of those tools; we only know enough
magical incantations by rote to get by, and blindly copy-paste commands
from the internet when we get stuck.

This class is an attempt to [address this](/about/).

We want to teach you how to make the most of the tools you know, show
you new tools to add to your toolbox, and hopefully instill in you some
excitement for exploring (and perhaps building) more tools on your own.
This is what we believe to be the missing semester from most Computer
Science curricula.

# Class structure

The not-for-credit class consists of nine 1-hour lectures, each one
centering on a [particular topic](/2026/). The lectures are largely
independent, though as the semester goes on we will presume that you are
familiar with the content from the earlier lectures. We have lecture
notes online, but there may be content covered in class (e.g. in the
form of demos) that may not be in the notes. As for past years, we will
be recording lectures and posting the recordings
[online](https://www.youtube.com/@MissingSemester).

We are trying to cover a lot of ground over the course of just a few
1-hour lectures, so the lectures are fairly dense. To allow you some
time to get familiar with the content at your own pace, each lecture
includes a set of exercises that guide you through the lecture's key
points. We will not be running dedicated office hours, but we encourage
you to ask questions on the [OSSU Discord](https://ossu.dev/#community),
in `#missing-semester-forum`, or email us at
[missing-semester@mit.edu](mailto:missing-semester@mit.edu).

Due to the limited time we have, we won't be able to cover all the tools
in the same level of detail a full-scale class might. Where possible, we
will try to point you towards resources for digging further into a tool
or topic, but if something particularly strikes your fancy, don't
hesitate to reach out to us and ask for pointers!

Finally, if you have feedback about the class, please send it to us by
email at [missing-semester@mit.edu](mailto:missing-semester@mit.edu).

# Topic 1: The Shell

{% comment %}

{% endcomment %}

## What is the shell?

Computers these days have a variety of interfaces for giving them
commands; fanciful graphical user interfaces, voice interfaces, AR/VR,
and more recently: LLMs. These are great for 80% of use-cases, but they
are often fundamentally restricted in what they allow you to do — you
cannot press a button that isn't there or give a voice command that
hasn't been programmed. To take full advantage of the tools your
computer provides, we have to go old-school and drop down to a textual
interface: The Shell.

Nearly all platforms you can get your hands on have a shell in one form
or another, and many of them have several shells for you to choose from.
While they may vary in the details, at their core they are all roughly
the same: they allow you to run programs, give them input, and inspect
their output in a semi-structured way.

To open a shell _prompt_ (where you can type commands), you first need a
_terminal_, which is the visual interface to a shell. Your device
probably shipped with one installed, or you can install one fairly
easily:

- **Linux:**
  Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` (works on most distributions). Or search for
  "Terminal" in your applications menu.
- **Windows:**
  Press `Win + R`, type `cmd` or `powershell`, and press Enter.
  Alternatively, search "Terminal" or "Command Prompt" in the Start menu.
- **macOS:**
  Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight, type "Terminal", and press Enter.
  Or find it in Applications → Utilities → Terminal.

On Linux and macOS, this will usually open the Bourne Again SHell, or
"bash" for short. This is one of the most widely used shells, and its
syntax is similar to what you will see in many other shells. On Windows,
you'll be greeted by the "batch" or "powershell" shells, depending on
which command you ran. These are Windows-specific, and not what we'll be
focusing on in this class, although it has analogues for most of what
we'll be teaching. You'll instead want the [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or a Linux virtual
machine.

Other shells exist, often with many ergonomic improvements over bash
(fish and zsh are among the most common). While these are very popular
(all the instructors use one), they're nowhere near as ubiquitous as
bash, and lean on many of the same concepts, so we won't be focusing on
those in this lecture.

## Why should you care about it?

The shell is not just (usually) much faster than "clicking around", it
also comes with expressive power you can't easily find in any one
graphical program. As we'll see, the shell gives you the ability to
_combine_ programs in creative ways to automate nearly any task.

Knowing your way around a shell is also very useful to navigate the
world of open-source software (which often come with install
instructions that require the shell), building continuous integration
for your software projects (as described in the [Code Quality
lecture](/2026/code-quality-plus-qa/)), and debugging errors when other programs
fail.

## Navigating in the shell

When you launch your terminal, you will see a _prompt_ that often looks
a little like this:

```console
missing:~$
```

This is the main textual interface to the shell. It tells you that you
are on the machine `missing` and that your "current working directory",
or where you currently are, is `~` (short for "home"). The `$` tells you
that you are not the root user (more on that later). At this prompt you
can type a _command_, which will then be interpreted by the shell. The
most basic command is to execute a program:

```console
missing:~$ date
Fri 10 Jan 2020 11:49:31 AM EST
missing:~$
```

Here, we executed the `date` program, which (perhaps unsurprisingly)
prints the current date and time. The shell then asks us for another
command to execute. We can also execute a command with _arguments_:

```console
missing:~$ echo hello
hello
```

In this case, we told the shell to execute the program `echo` with the
argument `hello`. The `echo` program simply prints out its arguments.
The shell parses the command by splitting it by whitespace, and then
runs the program indicated by the first word, supplying each subsequent
word as an argument that the program can access. If you want to provide
an argument that contains spaces or other special characters (e.g., a
directory named "My Photos"), you can either quote the argument with `'`
or `"` (`"My Photos"`), or escape just the relevant characters with `\`
(`My\ Photos`).

Perhaps the most important command when you're starting out is `man`,
short of "manual". The `man` program, among other things, lets you look
up more information about any command on your system. For example, if
you run `man date`, it'll explain what `date` is, and all of the various
arguments you can pass it to alter its behavior. You can also usually
get a short version of the help by passing `--help` as an argument to
most commands.

> to `man`, as it shows you common usage examples right there in the
> terminal. LLMs are also usually very good at explaining how commands
> work and how you can call them to achieve what you want to accomplish.

After `man`, the most important command to learn is `cd`, or "change
directory". This command is actually built into the shell, and isn't a
separate program (i.e., `which cd` will say "no cd found"). You pass it
a path, and that path becomes your current working directory. You'll
also see the working directory reflected in the shell prompt:

```console
missing:~$ cd /bin
missing:/bin$ cd /
missing:/$ cd ~
missing:~$
```

> Note that the shell comes with auto-completion, so you can often
> complete paths faster by pressing `<TAB>`!

A lot of commands operate on the current working directory if nothing
else is specified. If you're ever unsure where you are, you can run
`pwd` or print the `$PWD` environment variable (with `echo $PWD`), both
of which produce the current working directory.

The current working directory also comes in handy in that it allows us to
use _relative_ paths. All the paths we've seen so far have been
_absolute_ --- they start with `/` and give the full set of directories
needed to navigate to some location from the root of the file system
(`/`). In practice, you'll more commonly work with relative paths; so
called because they are relative to the current working directory. In a
relative path (anything _not_ starting with `/`), the first path
component is looked up in the current working directory, and subsequent
components traverse as usual. For example:

```console
missing:~$ cd /
missing:/$ cd bin
missing:/bin$
```

There are also two "special" components that exist in every directory:
`.` and `..`. `.` is "this directory", and `..` is "the parent
directory". So:

```console
missing:~$ cd /
missing:/$ cd bin/../bin/../bin/././../bin/..
missing:/$
```

You can usually use absolute and relative paths interchangeably for any
command argument, just keep in mind what your current working directory
is when using a relative one!

## What is available in the shell?

But how does the shell know how to find programs like `date` or `echo`?
If the shell is asked to execute a command, it consults an _environment
variable_ called `$PATH` that lists which directories the shell should
search for programs when it is given a command:

```console
missing:~$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
missing:~$ which echo
/bin/echo
missing:~$ /bin/echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
```

When we run the `echo` command, the shell sees that it should execute
the program `echo`, and then searches through the `:`-separated list of
directories in `$PATH` for a file by that name. When it finds it, it
runs it (assuming the file is _executable_; more on that later). We can
find out which file is executed for a given program name using the
`which` program. We can also bypass `$PATH` entirely by giving the
_path_ to the file we want to execute.

This also gives a clue for how we can determine _all_ the programs we're
able to execute in the shell: by listing the contents of all the
directories on `$PATH`. We can do this by passing a given directory path
to the `ls` program, which lists files:

```console
missing:~$ ls /bin
```

> Consider installing and using [`eza`](https://eza.rocks/) for a more
> human-friendly `ls`.

This will, on most computers, print a _lot_ of programs, but we'll only
focus on some of the most important ones here. First, some simple ones:

- `cat file`, which prints the contents of `file`.
- `sort file`, which prints out the lines of `file` in sorted order.
- `uniq file`, which eliminate consecutive duplicate lines from `file`.
- `head file` and `tail file`, which respectively print the first and
  last few lines of `file`.

> Consider installing and using [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
> over `cat` for syntax highlighting and scrolling.

There's also `grep pattern file`, which finds lines matching `pattern`
in `file`. This one deserves slightly more attention as it's both _very_
useful and sports a wider array of features than one may expect.
`pattern` is actually a _regular expression_ which can express very
complex patterns --- we'll [cover
those](/2026/code-quality-plus-qa/#regular-expressions-for-pattern-matching)
in the editor lecture. You can also specify a directory instead of a
file (or leave it off for `.`) and pass `-r` to recursively search all
the files in a directory.

> [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) over `grep` for a
> faster and more human-friendly (but less portable) alternative.
> `ripgrep` will also recursively search the current working directory
> by default!

There are also some very useful tools with a slightly more complicated
interface. First among those is `sed`, which is a programmatic file
editor. It has its own programming language for making automated edits
to files, but the most common use of it is:

```console
missing:~$ sed -i 's/pattern/replacement/g' file
```

This replaces all instances of `pattern` with `replacement` in `file`.
The `-i` indicates that we want the substitutions to happen inline (as
opposed to leaving `file` unmodified and printing the substituted
contents). The `s/` is the way to express in the sed programming
language that we want to do a substitution. The `/` separates the
pattern from the replacement. And the trailing `/g` indicates that we
want to replace _all_ occurrences on each line rather than just the
first. As with `grep`, `pattern` here is a regular expression, which
gives you significant expressive power. Regular expression substitutions
also allow `replacement` to refer back to parts of the matched pattern;
we'll see an example of that in a second.

Next, we have `find`, which lets you find files (recursively) that match
certain conditions. For example:

```console
missing:~$ find ~/Downloads -type f -name "*.zip" -mtime +30
```

Finds ZIP files in the download directory that are older than 30 days.

```console
missing:~$ find ~ -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} \;
```

Finds files larger than 100M in your home directory and lists them. Note
that `-exec` takes a _command_ terminated with a stand-alone `;` (which
we need to escape much like a space) where `{}` is replaced with each
matching file path by `find`.

```console
missing:~$ find . -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "TODO" {} \;
```

Finds any `.py` files with TODO items in them.

The syntax of `find` can be a little daunting, but hopefully this gives
you a sense of how useful it can be!

> Consider installing and using [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
> instead of `find` for a more human-friendly (but less portable!)
> experience.

Next on the docket is `awk`, which, like `sed`, has its own programming
language. Where `sed` is built for editing files, `awk` is built for
parsing them. By far the most common use of `awk` is for data files with
a regular syntax (like CSV files) where you want to extract only certain
parts of every record (i.e., line):

```console
missing:~$ awk '{print $2}' file
```

Prints the second whitespace-separated column of every line of `file`.
If you add `-F,`, it'll print the second comma-separated column of every
line. `awk` can do much more --- filtering rows, computing aggregates,
and more --- see the exercises for a taste.

Putting these tools together, we can do fancy things like:

```console
missing:~$ ssh myserver 'journalctl -u sshd -b-1 | grep "Disconnected from"' \
  | sed -E 's/.*Disconnected from .* user (.*) [^ ]+ port.*/\1/' \
  | sort | uniq -c \
  | sort -nk1,1 | tail -n10 \
  | awk '{print $2}' | paste -sd,
postgres,mysql,oracle,dell,ubuntu,inspur,test,admin,user,root
```

This grabs SSH logs from a remote server (we'll talk more about `ssh` in
the next lecture), searches for disconnect messages, extracts the
username from each such message, and prints the top 10 usernames
comma-separated. All in one command! We'll leave dissecting each step as
an exercise.

## The shell language (bash)

The previous example introduced a new concept: pipes (`|`). These let
you string together the output of one program with the input of another.
This works because most command-line programs will operate on their
"standard input" (where your keystrokes normally go) if no `file`
argument is given. `|` takes the "standard output" (what normally gets
printed to your terminal) of the program before the `|` and makes it be
the standard input of the program after the `|`. This allows you to
_compose_ shell programs, and it's part of what makes the shell such a
productive environment to work in!

In fact, most shells implement a full programming language (like bash),
just like Python or Ruby. It has variables, conditionals, loops, and
functions. When you run commands in your shell, you are really writing a
small bit of code that your shell interprets. We won't teach you all of
bash today, but there are some bits you'll find particularly useful:

First, redirects: `>file` lets you take the standard output of a program
and write it to `file` instead of to your terminal. This makes it easier
to analyze after the fact. `>>file` will append to `file` rather than
overwrite it. There's also `<file` which tells the shell to read from
`file` instead of from your keyboard as the standard input to a program.

> This is a good time to mention the `tee` program. `tee` will print
> standard input to standard output (just like `cat`!), but will _also_
> write it to a file. So `verbose cmd | tee verbose.log | grep CRITICAL`
> will preserve the full verbose log to a file while keeping your
> terminal clean!

Next, conditionals: `if command1; then command2; command3; fi` will
execute `command1`, and if it doesn't result in an error, will run
`command2` and `command3`. You can also have an `else` branch if you
wish. The most common command to use as `command1` is the `test`
command, often abbreviated simply as `[`, which lets you evaluate
conditions like "does a file exist" (`test -f file` / `[ -f file ]`) or
"does a string equal another" (`[ "$var" = "string" ]`). In bash,
there's also `[[ ]]`, which is a "safer" built-in version of `test` that
has fewer odd behaviours around quoting.

Bash also has two forms of loops, `while` and `for`. `while command1; do
command2; command3; done` functions just like the equivalent `if`
command, except that it will re-execute the whole thing over and over
for as long as `command1` does not error. `for varname in a b c d; do
command; done` executes `command` four times, each time with `$varname`
set to one of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Instead of listing the items
explicitly, you'll often use "command substitution", such as:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do
```

This executes the command `seq 1 10` (which prints the numbers from 1 to
10 inclusive) and then replaces the whole `$()` with that command's
output, giving you a 10-iteration for loop. In older code you'll
sometimes see literal backticks (like ``for i in `seq 1 10`; do``)
instead of `$()`, but you should strongly prefer the `$()` form as it
can be nested.

While you _can_ write long shell scripts directly in your prompt, you'll
usually want to write them into a `.sh` file instead. For example,
here's a script that will run a program in a loop until it fails,
printing the output only of the failed run, while stressing your CPU in
the background (useful to reproduce flaky tests for example):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

# Start CPU stress in background
stress --cpu 8 &
STRESS_PID=$!

# Setup log file
LOGFILE="test_runs_$(date +%s).log"
echo "Logging to $LOGFILE"

# Run tests until one fails
RUN=1
while cargo test my_test > "$LOGFILE" 2>&1; do
    echo "Run $RUN passed"
    ((RUN++))
done

# Cleanup and report
kill $STRESS_PID
echo "Test failed on run $RUN"
echo "Last 20 lines of output:"
tail -n 20 "$LOGFILE"
echo "Full log: $LOGFILE"
```

This has a number of new things in it that I recommend you spend some
time diving into, as they're very useful in crafting useful shell
invocations like background jobs (`&`) to run programs concurrently,
trickier [shell
redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html),
and [arithmetic
expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arithmetic-Expansion.html).

It's worth spending a second on the first two lines of the program
though. The first is the "shebang" -- you'll see this at the top of
other files than shell scripts too. When a file that starts with the
magic incantation `#!/path` is executed, the shell will start the
program at `/path`, and pass it the contents of the file as input. In
the case of a shell script, this means passing the contents of the shell
script to `/bin/bash`, but you can also write Python scripts with a
shebang line of `/usr/bin/python`!

The second line is a way to make bash "stricter", and mitigate a number
of footguns when writing shell scripts. `set` can take a whole lot of
arguments, but briefly: `-e` makes it so that if any command fails, the
script exits early; `-u` makes it so that use of undefined variables
crashes the script rather than just using an empty string; and `-o
pipefail` makes it so that if programs in a `|` sequence fail, the
shell script as a whole also exits early.

# Next steps

At this point you know your way around a shell enough to accomplish
basic tasks. You should be able to navigate around to find files of
interest and use the basic functionality of most programs. In the next
lecture, we will talk about how to perform and automate more complex
tasks using the shell and the many handy command-line programs out
there.

# Exercises

All classes in this course are accompanied by a series of exercises.
Some give you a specific task to do, while others are open-ended, like
"try using X and Y programs". We highly encourage you to try them out.

We have not written solutions for the exercises. If you are stuck on
anything in particular, feel free to post in `#missing-semester-forum`
on [Discord](https://ossu.dev/#community) or send us an email describing
what you've tried so far, and we will try to help you out. These
exercises will also likely work well as initial prompts in a
conversation with an LLM where you can interactively dive into the
topic. The real value in these exercises is the journey of discovering
the answers, not the answer itself. We encourage you to follow tangents
and ask "why" as you work through them, rather than just looking for the
shortest path to the solution.

1. For this course, you need to be using a Unix shell like Bash or ZSH. If
   you are on Linux or macOS, you don't have to do anything special. If you
   are on Windows, you need to make sure you are not running cmd.exe or
   PowerShell; you can use [Windows Subsystem for
   Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or a Linux virtual
   machine to use Unix-style command-line tools. To make sure you're running
   an appropriate shell, you can try the command `echo $SHELL`. If it says
   something like `/bin/bash` or `/usr/bin/zsh`, that means you're running
   the right program.

1. What does the `-l` flag to `ls` do? Run `ls -l /` and examine the output.
   What do the first 10 characters of each line mean? (Hint: `man ls`)

1. In the command `find ~/Downloads -type f -name "*.zip" -mtime +30`, the
   `*.zip` is a "glob". What is a glob? Create a test directory with some
   files and experiment with patterns like `ls *.txt`, `ls file?.txt`, and
   `ls {a,b,c}.txt`. See [Pattern
   Matching](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Pattern-Matching.html)
   in the Bash manual.

1. What's the difference between `'single quotes'`, `"double quotes"`, and
   `$'ANSI quotes'`? Write a command that echoes a string containing a
   literal `$`, a `!`, and a newline character. See
   [Quoting](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Quoting.html).

1. The shell has three standard streams: stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr
   (2). Run `ls /nonexistent /tmp` and redirect stdout to one file and
   stderr to another. How would you redirect both to the same file? See
   [Redirections](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Redirections.html).

1. `$?` holds the exit status of the last command (0 = success). `&&` runs
   the next command only if the previous succeeded; `||` runs it only if
   the previous failed. Write a one-liner that creates `/tmp/mydir` only if
   it doesn't already exist. See [Exit
   Status](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Exit-Status.html).

1. Why does `cd` have to be built into the shell itself rather than a
   standalone program? (Hint: think about what a child process can and
   cannot affect in its parent.)

1. Write a script that takes a filename as an argument (`$1`) and checks
   whether the file exists using `test -f` or `[ -f ... ]`. It should print
   different messages depending on whether the file exists. See [Bash
   Conditional
   Expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html).

1. Save the script from the previous exercise to a file (e.g., `check.sh`).
   Try running it with `./check.sh somefile`. What happens? Now run
   `chmod +x check.sh` and try again. Why is this step necessary? (Hint:
   look at `ls -l check.sh` before and after the `chmod`.)

1. What happens if you add `-x` to the `set` flags in a script? Try it with
    a simple script and observe the output. See [The Set
    Builtin](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html).

1. Write a command that copies a file to a backup with today's date in the
    filename (e.g., `notes.txt` → `notes_2026-01-12.txt`). (Hint: `$(date
    +%Y-%m-%d)`). See [Command
    Substitution](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html).

1. Modify the flaky test script from the lecture to accept the test command
    as an argument instead of hardcoding `cargo test my_test`. (Hint: `$1`
    or `$@`). See [Special
    Parameters](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Special-Parameters.html).

1. Use pipes to find the 5 most common file extensions in your home
    directory. (Hint: combine `find`, `grep` or `sed` or `awk`, `sort`,
    `uniq -c`, and `head`.)

1. `xargs` converts lines from stdin into command arguments. Use `find` and
    `xargs` together (not `find -exec`) to find all `.sh` files in a
    directory and count the lines in each with `wc -l`. Bonus: make it
    handle filenames with spaces. (Hint: `-print0` and `-0`). See `man
    xargs`.

1. Use `curl` to fetch the HTML of the course website
    (`https://missing.csail.mit.edu/`) and pipe it to `grep` to count how
    many lectures are listed. (Hint: look for a pattern that appears once
    per lecture; use `curl -s` to silence the progress output.)

1. [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is a powerful tool for processing
    JSON data. Fetch the sample data at
    `https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/json-dummy-data/64KB.json` with
    `curl` and use `jq` to extract just the names of people whose version
    is greater than 6. (Hint: pipe to `jq .` first to see the structure;
    then try `jq '.[] | select(...) | .name'`)

1. `awk` can filter lines based on column values and manipulate output.
    For example, `awk '$3 ~ /pattern/ {$4=""; print}'` prints only lines
    where the third column matches `pattern`, while omitting the fourth
    column. Write an `awk` command that prints only lines where the second
    column is greater than 100, and swaps the first and third columns. Test
    with: `printf 'a 50 x\nb 150 y\nc 200 z\n'`

1. Dissect the SSH log pipeline from the lecture: what does each step do?
    Then build something similar to find your most-used shell commands from
    `~/.bash_history` (or `~/.zsh_history`).
