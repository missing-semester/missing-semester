This page is under construction for the IAP 2026 offering of Missing Semester. This lecture will cover topics similar to the [Editors (Vim)](/2020/editors/) lecture from the 2020 offering, as well as substantial new material.

In this lecture, we'll cover:

- Editors (like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), LSP
- AI coding assistants: autocomplete, coding agents (like [Claude Code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code)) and how to use them effectively
- Efficient text editing, [Vim](/2020/editors/) mode
- Devcontainers
- Non-editor code tools (like [semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep))

lecturer: Anish

- Editors generally (IDEs, agentic IDEs, collaborative editing (e.g., Zed), VS Code), autocomplete, LSP
    - AI: how to write a spec, vibe coding, how to use AI more broadly
        - Overview of AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, Claude, CodeWhisperer)
        - Effective prompt engineering for code (providing context, using roles, breaking down requests)
        - Critical evaluation skills: reviewing AI output for bugs, security issues, hallucinations
        - The "70% problem", AI gets you most of the way, but expertise matters for the rest
        - Anti-patterns: overreliance, shallow understanding, debugging spirals
- Efficient text editing, Vim mode
- Devcontainers (Docker covered in more detail later)
- Non-editor code tools (like semgrep)
- "Reading comprehension", looking at origin materials (e.g., RFCs, first-party documentation / reference over blog posts and tutorials); reading source code, navigating unfamiliar code bases
