Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems
to machine learning, but there's one critical subject that's rarely covered,
and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with
their tools. We'll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful
text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

Students spend hundreds of hours using these tools over the course of their
education (and thousands over their career), so it makes sense to make the
experience as fluid and frictionless as possible. Mastering these tools not
only enables you to spend less time on figuring out how to bend your tools to
your will, but it also lets you solve problems that would previously seem
impossibly complex.

These days, many aspects of software engineering are also in flux
through the introduction of AI-enabled and AI-enhanced tools and
workflows. When used appropriately and with awareness of their
shortcomings, these can often provide significant benefits to
CS practitioners and are thus worth developing working knowledge of.
Since AI is a cross-functional enabling technology, there is not a
standalone AI lecture; we've instead folded the use of the latest
applicable AI tools and techniques into each lecture directly.

**Discussion**: [OSSU Discord](https://ossu.dev/#community), in `#missing-semester`

<ul>
{% assign lectures = site['2026'] | sort: 'date' %}
{% for lecture in lectures %}
    {% if lecture.phony != true %}
        <li>
        <strong>{{ lecture.date | date: '%-m/%d/%y' }}</strong>:
        {% if lecture.ready %}
            <a href="{{ lecture.url }}">{{ lecture.title }}</a>
        {% else %}
            {{ lecture.title }} {% if lecture.noclass %}[no class]{% endif %}
        {% endif %}
        </li>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>

We are still finalizing the syllabus for the IAP 2026 offering, so the topics
we cover may change slightly.

If you can't wait until January 2026, you can also take a look at the lectures
from the [previous offering of the course](/2020/), which covers many of the
same topics.
